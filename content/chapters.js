    content: [
      "The atmosphere in Bhurban was serene. Nestled amidst the rolling hills, the venue hosted officers from across the country—and beyond. It was a rare convergence of minds, ideas, and cultures, all gathered under the pretext of learning and collaboration.",
      "Bhurban is a picturesque hill station in the Murree Hills region, located in Punjab, Pakistan, approximately 13 kilometers from the popular tourist destination of Murree. Nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, Bhurban is renowned for its serene environment, lush green meadows, dense pine forests, and breathtaking views of the mountains.",
      "I remember stepping into Bhurban with excitement bubbling within me, though I wore the mask of composure. The journey from Karachi had been long but exhilarating, a chance to momentarily escape the grind of city life. Little did I know, something unexpected awaited me?",
      "On the first day, everyone lingered around Xavier Hall, an elegant yet intimidating space, waiting for the introductory class. The air buzzed with the dull hum of strangers attempting to bridge the awkward gaps between them. Unable to suppress my restlessness, I slipped out for a smoke.",
      "The crisp mountain air greeted me, but a problem quickly surfaced—I had forgotten my cigarette packet in my room on the second floor. With a sigh, I trudged back up the stairs, my mind wandering over the agenda of the day.",
      "As I stepped out of my room with the packet in hand, the echo of hurried footsteps followed me down the hallway.",
      "“Excuse me?”",
      "Startled, I turned to find the source of the voice.",
      "She stood a few feet away, her presence commanding attention without effort. A girl in a crisp white shirt and black pants, her hair cascading freely over her shoulders, and a smile that could melt glaciers. For a moment, I forgot where I was—or perhaps even who I was.",
      "“Yes?” I managed, my voice barely audible.",
      "“I’m Sanvi. Sanvi Sinha,  basically from India presently settled in United Kingdom,” Her voice was calm yet confident, with a lilting charm that added to the spell she seemed to cast. “What’s your good name?”",
      "Caught off guard by her directness and mesmerized by her beauty, my words stumbled over themselves. “Mmm... Musavir,” I stammered, feeling the heat rise to my face.",
      "She chuckled softly, clearly amused by my discomfort, her eyes dancing with mischief. “Well, Musavir, nice to meet you.”",
      "Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked away, leaving me standing there, clutching my cigarette packet like it was the only thing anchoring me to reality.",
      "For the next few moments, I remained rooted to the spot, replaying the encounter in my head. Who was this Sanvi? And why did her presence feel like a spark that had ignited something within me?",
      "The sound of murmuring voices and shuffling feet from Xavier Hall snapped me back to the present. The class was about to begin, and yet, I couldn't shake off the lingering traces of her smile.",
      "As I re-entered Xavier Hall, my heart raced—not because of the training, but because of the whirlwind that had just occurred in the corridor. My mind was still spinning from my encounter with Sanvi. Thinking I might be late for the first session, I braced myself for the judgmental glances that often follow tardiness. But to my relief, the trainer hadn’t arrived yet.",
      "I quickly scanned the room and found a seat behind Rimsha, a colleague from my office. She was chatting animatedly with a group of officers from other departments, exchanging introductions and expectations for the training. I joined in, trying to focus, but my mind kept straying to the girl in white and black.",
      "The casual conversation was interrupted by the creak of the door swinging open. The soft chatter came to a halt, and I instinctively turned toward the entrance. At first, all I could see were her feet. White, polished, and delicate, adorned with a dainty anklet on her left foot, just above her shoes. The subtle clinking of the chain felt like a melody against the silence, and for a moment, the world around me faded.",
      "The footsteps echoed in my mind as though they were part of a romantic overture. Slowly, I raised my gaze, and there she was—Sanvi. Her presence filled the room, effortlessly commanding attention. My throat went dry, my pulse quickened, and it felt as though my heart was sinking into some uncharted depth.",

      "She walked to the rostrum with the confidence of someone who knew they belonged in the spotlight. Her smile was faint but warm, and her eyes briefly swept over the crowd before landing on me. For a split second, I felt like I was the only one in the room, as if her smile was a secret meant only for me.",
      "She spoke, her voice clear and confident, carrying the hint of a smile.",
      "“I am Sanvi Sinha, your master trainer for this project,” she began, her words resonating in the silent hall. “I’ve traveled here all the way from India, not just to train you, but to experience something new—to meet people, to share, and to learn.”",
      "She paused, letting her words settle, and then added with a playful glint in her eyes, “And I must say, a good experience has already amused me.”",
      "Her gaze met mine again, and this time, her smile deepened, carrying an unmistakable hint of mischief. I could feel the heat rise to my face as I struggled to suppress a smile of my own. Was she talking about me? Or was this just her way of connecting with the group?",
      "The room erupted in applause, but my hands remained frozen in place. My thoughts were trapped in the magnetic pull of her presence. Sanvi had effortlessly taken control of the moment, and with her, she had taken a piece of my attention—perhaps even my heart.",
      "As she began explaining the agenda for the training, I found myself unable to focus. Her words sounded distant, like background music to the symphony playing in my mind. My colleagues asked questions, and discussions ensued, but I remained quiet, lost in my thoughts.",
      "One thing was certain: this training was going to be more than just an academic experience.",

    title: "Sudden Encounter",
    content: [
      `As the day drew to a close, Sanvi called off the session with her
signature charm, leaving the room buzzing with energy and chatter.
Officers exchanged pleasantries and recounted moments from the day as
they began heading back to their rooms. I, on the other hand, walked
slower than usual, as if the weight of her words in the class was holding
me back. My body might have felt tired, but my mind replayed every
moment—her voice, her smile, the way she spoke with confidence, and,
most of all, the way her eyes occasionally landed on me.`,
      `Lost in thought, I barely noticed her until she appeared beside me,
walking at the same pace. She had a knack for catching me off guard, it
seemed.`,
      `“Mmm... Musavir,” she said teasingly, drawing out my name with a playful
smirk. “How was the day today?”`,
      `Her tone was light, almost mischievous, and it brought me out of my
trance. I managed a faint smile, but my words failed me once again.
“Good,” I replied, my voice barely above a whisper.`,
      `She chuckled, the sound both soothing and disarming. “Good,” she
repeated, mimicking my tone, and I couldn’t help but smile wider.`,
      `We walked together in silence for a while, our footsteps echoing down
the quiet hallway. The elevator doors slid open, and we stepped inside.
The soft hum of the elevator filled the silence, punctuated only by the
faint sound of PC Bhurban’s promotional videos playing on the screen.`,
      `I was acutely aware of her presence beside me, but I didn’t know what to
say. My nervous energy betrayed me, and I found myself biting my nails
absentmindedly—a habit I thought I’d outgrown.`,
      `She noticed, of course. Breaking the silence, she said with a playful grin,
“You know, people tend to do that when they’re deep in thought or
confused.”`,
      `Her comment caught me off guard, and I quickly pulled my hand away
from my mouth, embarrassed. She laughed softly, and her laughter felt
like a melody that made the enclosed elevator space seem warmer.`,
      `Before I could think of a reply, the elevator doors opened with a gentle
ding. We both stepped out and walked down the corridor together. The
soft carpet muffled our footsteps, but my heart was pounding so loudly I
was sure she could hear it.`,
      `We reached room 209, and she stopped in front of the door. She turned
to me, her smile as radiant as ever. “Goodbye, Mmm Musavir,” she said
with a playful twinkle in her eye.`,
      `“Goodbye,” I managed to say, my voice laced with shyness.`,
      `She opened the door and stepped inside, pausing for a brief moment to
glance back at me with that same captivating smile before closing the
door behind her.`,
      `For a moment, I stood there in the empty corridor, unsure of what had
just happened. It felt like the entire day had been leading up to this
moment, and now that it was over, I didn’t know what to do with myself.`,
      `I trudged down the hall to room 213, still lost in thought, and threw
myself onto the bed. Staring up at the ceiling, I couldn’t help but replay
the entire encounter in my head. The way she teased me, the way she
smiled, the way her presence seemed to fill every space she entered, it
was all too much and yet not enough.`,
      `With a deep sigh, I closed my eyes, trying to calm my racing
thoughts……!!!!`,

    title: "HikinG",
    content: [
      `The cozy silence of my room was interrupted by the sharp chime of the
      doorbell. I jolted upright, my heart racing with excitement and
      anticipation. Could it be her? Was it Sanvi at my door? For a brief
      moment, my mind ran wild with possibilities—perhaps she had come to
      share some thought from class or even just to tease me again with her
      mischievous grin.`,
      `I swung the door open in a rush, only to find Talha standing there,
      grinning as usual. My excitement fizzled out instantly, replaced by a mix
      of disappointment and guilt. Talha was my close friend, and while I
      appreciated his company, at that moment, I had hoped for someone else.`,
      `“Yaar, let’s go for a hike,” he said, full of enthusiasm. “Golf Club is nearby,
      and the weather is perfect.”`,
      `I hesitated. My mind was still spinning with thoughts of Sanvi, and hiking
      was the last thing I wanted to do. But saying no to Talha wasn’t an easy
      task—it always came with long explanations, counterarguments, and
      sometimes even guilt-tripping. Given my less-than-stellar history of
      backing out of plans, I sighed and nodded.`,
      `“Fine,” I said, forcing a smile.`,
      `The hike turned out to be more enjoyable than I had expected. The cool
      evening breeze, the lush greenery of Bhurban, and the scenic views of the
      Golf Club worked their magic. Talha, as always, kept the mood lively with
      his humor and unending energy. We rested at a small restaurant nestled
      within the Golf Club, ordering tea and snacks while soaking in the peaceful
      surroundings.`,
      `As we sat there, we bumped into some other participants from the
      training. The informal setting made for great conversations, with jokes,
      shared anecdotes, and discussions about the day’s session. On the
      surface, everything seemed perfect—a beautiful evening, good company,
      and a sense of camaraderie.`,
      `But deep down, my thoughts refused to stay tethered to the present.
      Sanvi’s voice echoed in my mind, her playful teasing replaying like a
      favorite song. I found myself staring into my cup of tea, imagining her
      sitting across the table, sharing her thoughts on life, culture, and
      experiences.`,
      `“Musavir, are you even here?” Talha’s voice jolted me back to reality.`,
      `“Huh? Yeah, I’m here,” I replied, forcing a laugh.`,
      `“Sure doesn’t look like it,” he said, eyeing me suspiciously but letting it
      slide.`,
      `By 8 PM, we were back at the hotel. I returned to my room, physically
      tired but mentally restless. After a quiet dinner, I decided to take a
      short walk around the hotel grounds. The crisp night air and the soft glow
      of the lights helped calm my racing thoughts, but only slightly.`,
      `Back in my room, I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling. My mind drifted
      once again to Sanvi—her smile, her voice, her playful way of teasing me. I
      wondered what she was doing at that moment. Was she thinking about the
      training? About home? Or maybe… just maybe… about me?`,
      `As the clock struck 12:30 AM, I finally drifted off to sleep, my dreams
      filled with glimpses of her face and echoes of her laughter. Tomorrow
      was another day, and I couldn’t wait to see where fate—or Sanvi—would
      take me next.`,

    title: "Wet Eyes",
    content: [
      `Your deep, naughty eyes, a playful spark,
      Whispering secrets in the quiet dark.
      White teeth that gleam like the moon’s soft glow,
      A smile that melts, and makes time slow.`,
      `Silky strands that cascade like a dream,
      Dancing in the light with a gentle gleam.
      Your voice, a melody, smooth and sweet,
      In every word, my heart skips a beat.`,
      `I'm addicted, entranced by your sight,
      By the warmth of your smile, the fragrance of night.
      Caught in your charm, I can&#39;t break free,
      For you&#39;re a beautiful mystery to me.`,
      `Is it not curious, how a single person can so suddenly occupy the entire
      landscape of our thoughts, as if they were the center of our universe?
      We often find ourselves caught in the orbit of someone else&#39;s presence,
      as if our minds, once vast and free, have now become tethered to the
      gravity of another. Perhaps this pull is not so much a force of love, but an
      instinctual response to a deeper need—an attempt to fill a void we
      weren’t fully aware existed. Love, then, might not always be the magnetic
      force we imagine it to be. It could simply be the heart&#39;s reaction to a
      fleeting moment of connection, an attempt to break free from the cold
      emptiness of solitude. What we perceive as love could, in truth, be
      nothing more than our mind and heart craving a focal point, someone to
      anchor us when the world feels vast and uncertain. Is this attachment or
      love? Or, is it simply the human condition seeking meaning in the midst of
      uncertainty??????`,
      `I lay on the bed, my body sinking into the mattress, but my mind was
      racing. The ceiling above me seemed so far away, almost like it was part
      of a different world. The soft tick-tick of the wall clock echoed in the
      silence, each second stretching endlessly, a reminder of time slipping
      away, of something that I couldn’t quite grasp.`,
      `And there was the Mona Lisa—her eyes, so mysterious, following me
      wherever I went, it felt like. Why had I been staring at that painting so
      much lately? What was it about her serene smile that made me think of
      Sanvi? Every time my mind wandered, it was to her: her soft voice, the
      way her eyes held mine for just a second too long, the curve of her smile
      that made my heart race.`,
      `What has happened to me? Why couldn’t I shake her off? What was it
      about Sanvi, someone who, in the grand scheme of things, was just a
      stranger I met yesterday, that had captured me so completely? We were
      only here for six nights, six fleeting days—what happened after that?
      Would she simply fade from my memory like the others before her, or
      would something more... something deeper linger?`,
      `I kept asking myself these questions, my mind a whirlpool of confusion
      and longing. The more I thought about it, the more I felt a strange sense
      of emptiness, like I was missing something, or someone. It was as if a part
      of me had been erased, leaving me lost and adrift. Was I dying? Had I
      already died? I wondered for a moment, my heart beating faster as panic
      set in.`,
      `But then, through the haze of my thoughts, a surge of something deep
      within me pushed me to act. With a shaky breath, I gathered the
      strength to sit up, my body trembling as I wiped my eyes, only to realize
      they were wet. Tears. I didn’t know when they had started, but they were
      there, streaking down my face. The pillow beneath me was soaked, my
      grief, a quiet storm that had taken over.`,
      `How had the night come to this? How had it turned so unbearably heavy?
      The hours dragged on as I fought to steady myself, only to be met by an
      unrelenting tide of emotions I couldn’t name. Pain. Confusion. Regret.
      Longing. But no answers, nothing clear.`,

    content: [
      `The alarm bell was my first betrayal of the day, though I had no one but
      myself to blame. Sleepless, disoriented, and caught in a whirlwind of
      panic, I realized it wasn’t the first time it had rung—it was the fourth.`,
      `My heart sank as I glanced at the clock. Fifteen minutes left. Fifteen
      minutes to not just get ready but to make it to Xaver Hall, where
      punctuality wasn’t just expected—it was demanded.`,
      `Without thinking, I jumped out of bed and dashed to the
      washroom. A quick shower—what we humorously call a Lahore
      bath—ensued. No soap, no shampoo, just a hurried splash of water to
      erase the night’s weariness. Time was slipping away. My tie felt like a
      puzzle, and the pocket square an unnecessary luxury. Still, I somehow
      managed to look half-decent, grabbing two cookies on my way out. I
      crammed them into my mouth, chewing as I sprinted, and the crumbs
      falling like my lost seconds.`,
      `The hall loomed ahead, its grandeur mocking my haphazard state. I
      adjusted my tie one last time, took a deep breath, and stepped in.`,
      `The room was already alive with whispers and faint scribbles of
      pens. Heads turned briefly in my direction, but my attention was snagged
      by one gaze in particular—Sanvi’s.`,
      `Her eyes met mine, and I could swear there was a glimmer of amusement
      in them. My heart stuttered, caught between embarrassment and
      intrigue. That’s when it happened. My diary, clutched loosely in my hands,
      slipped and tumbled to the floor. I bent down to retrieve it, only for my
      phone to slide out of my pocket and crash onto the cold tiles. A soft
      giggle reached my ears—her giggle.`,
      `I glanced up. Sanvi’s lips pressed together in an attempt to stifle her
      smile, but her eyes betrayed her. She was enjoying this; my state of
      disarray, my frantic movements. And not for the first time. She always
      seemed to relish these moments, not out of malice, but with a kind of
      endearing mischief.`,
      `As I straightened up, clutching both my diary and phone, I couldn’t help
      but feel oddly grateful for the chaos. In that fleeting moment, her smile
      made my disastrous morning seem a little less catastrophic. Perhaps,
      amidst all my fumbling, I had stumbled onto something else entirely.`,
      `As she attempted to draw attention away from my obvious confusion and
      disarray, she spoke, &#39;Attention, please.&#39; Everyone immediately turned
      their focus to her, and I silently thanked her with a glance, grateful for
      her attempt to shield me from the discomfort of my embarrassment. But
      she didn’t acknowledge my silent gratitude. Her expression remained
      unreadable, her gaze cool and indifferent, despite meeting mine. I felt
      like I was slowly dying under the weight of it all.`,
      `I sat in the lecture hall, my mind a jumbled mess of thoughts. Everything
      felt unclear, like I was trying to put together pieces of a puzzle, but they
      just wouldn’t fit. Yesterday, Sanvi—our trainer—had been so warm, so
      friendly. It had felt like more than just professional kindness, something
      I had convinced myself was a little bit special. But today? She was
      distant, cold even. It was as if I were invisible.`,
      `I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I dreamt about her all night. Her smile.
      Her laughter. Her words. And I couldn’t help but wonder: why did she
      care about my embarrassment yesterday? Why had she been so warm
      towards me? Maybe it wasn’t anything personal. Maybe she just had that
      kind of friendly nature. She had said it herself when we first met—“I’m
      here to make memories and make friends.”`,
      `I replayed those words in my mind again and again. At the time, they had
      felt so genuine, so full of possibility. But now, with her distant attitude, it
      felt like I had misunderstood everything. I had let myself hope for
      something more.`,
      `Musavir, shut up, I scolded myself. She’s just a trainer. Just a trainer.`,
      `The words sounded harsh in my mind, but they were the truth. Sanvi was
      just a trainer. She liked meeting new people, making friends. That’s all.`,
      `But the thoughts wouldn’t stop. Why did I even care? It was just a silly
      crush. It wasn’t real. Get over it, I told myself again.`,
      `Lost in my own thoughts, I barely noticed someone calling my name. Mr.
      Musavir. It wasn’t Sanvi’s voice—of course not. I assumed it was someone
      else. But then, I felt a hand on my shoulder. A heavy, confident hand that
      jolted me back into reality.`,
      `I turned, startled, to find a man with a beard and a smile standing in
      front of me. My heart thudded in my chest. I had no idea who he was at
      first.`,
      `"Mr. Musavir," he said, his voice warm but with a certain authority.
      "Where have you been? I believe you weren&#39;t here earlier."`,
      `I blinked, still disoriented. "I… I’m here, sir," I managed to say, almost in
      a whisper. He smiled again, but I could hardly focus on what he was saying
      after that. His lecture continued, but my mind kept racing, trying to
      figure out where Sanvi had gone. Was she still here? Did she notice my
      awkwardness? Or had she already moved on, forgotten about me like I
      was nothing?`,
      `I tried to listen to the lecture, but it felt pointless. My mind was
      elsewhere, trapped in this whirlwind of confusion. I remembered how I
      used to skip classes back in the Civil Services academy. It wasn’t
      something I was proud of, but it was something I did. And now, sitting
      there, I felt that same rebellious urge rising in me again. I wanted to
      escape. I didn’t want to deal with the confusion, with the mixed signals.`,
      `I stood up quietly, hoping no one would notice, and slipped out of the
      classroom. The door clicked shut behind me, and I was free. Free to
      think. Free to get away from all the questions that swirled in my head.`,
      `Walking down the empty hallways, I couldn’t stop thinking about her.
      About Sanvi. Her kindness, her smile, her words. Did I mean anything to
      her? Or was I just another student in a room full of them? The truth
      was, I didn’t know. And maybe that was for the best. Maybe some things
      were never meant to be figured out.`,
      `I smiled bitterly to myself as I stepped outside into the cool air. I didn’t
      know where I was going, but I needed to clear my head.`,

      `Lost in her thoughts, I longed to return to my sleep. Heading toward the
      room, I quickened my pace, hoping to catch a glimpse of her in the
      corridor. Just a few steps ahead, I heard someone call my name. My heart
      sank. &quot;No, not now. This can’t be happening,&quot; I muttered under my breath.
      Hesitating, I turned around—only to see Talha standing there, grinning
      from ear to ear.`,
      `&quot;Why did you bunk class?&quot; he asked, his smile as bright as ever.`,
      `&quot;Yar, I was tired. I needed a nap,&quot; I replied, trying to mask my irritation.`,
      `&quot;Let’s go to the Pipeline track from Nathiagali to Ayubia,&quot; he suggested
      enthusiastically.`,
      `I shook my head. &quot;What I need right now is sleep,&quot; I said firmly, brushing
      him off. &quot;Go back and attend your class.&quot;`,
      `Disappointed, he muttered something about me being rude and walked
      away, tossing a few half-hearted curses in my direction. But my refusal
      wasn’t just about sleep. It was the hope of seeing her again that held me
      back.`,
      `Reaching the elevator, I groaned upon finding it out of order. The stairs
      it was, then. Each step wore me down, but my determination to catch that
      smile kept me moving. When I finally reached my floor, my heart sank.
      The hallway was empty, her door ajar with a housekeeping cart parked
      outside—a silent confirmation that she wasn’t there.`,
      `Disheartened, I opened my own door and tried slamming it shut, but the
      slow, resistant doors of PC Bhurban refused to cooperate. Frustrated, I
      slumped against the doorframe. &quot;What is happening to me? Sanvi... what
      have you done to me? Where has my carefree self gone?&quot;`,
      `The weight of my thoughts was unbearable. In a moment of surrender, I
      grabbed my phone and called Talha. &quot;Let’s go to the Pipeline track,&quot; I said
      abruptly.`,
      `Minutes later, we were in a taxi heading to Nathiagali.`,
      `The taxi sped through the winding roads of Murree, the lush green hills
      outside blurring as my mind replayed the morning’s events. Sanvi—her
      name echoed in my head like an unfinished symphony. Why had she taken
      over my thoughts like this? Her laughter, her subtle smile, even the way
      she absentmindedly twirled her hair—it all haunted me. And yet, I hadn’t
      seen her all day.`,
      `Talha, sitting beside me, seemed oddly quiet for someone who had been so
      eager to drag me out to the Pipeline track. He probably thought I was
      sulking over my missed nap, but little did he know, sleep was the last thing
      on my mind.`,
      `“You know,” Talha broke the silence, “you’ve been acting weird lately. You
      used to be the guy who never said no to adventures, the guy who made
      everyone laugh. Now you’re just…” He paused, searching for the right
      word, “lost.”`,
      `I didn’t respond. What could I say? That I was losing myself to someone
      who probably didn’t even know the chaos she’d stirred within me?`,
      `The taxi dropped us off at the start of the trail. The air was crisp,
      carrying the scent of pine and earth, but it did little to calm the storm in
      my chest. Talha, oblivious to my inner turmoil, was already taking pictures,
      posing dramatically against the backdrop of towering trees and distant
      peaks.`,
      `As we began walking the track, I couldn’t help but think of Sanvi. Would
      she have liked this place? Maybe she had been here before. The thought
      of her walking these same trails made my heart ache in a way I couldn’t
      quite explain.`,
      `Talha, noticing my distracted state, nudged me. “Come on, man. At least
      pretend to enjoy this. You’re in the middle of paradise, and you’re acting
      like you’re at a funeral.”`,
      `I forced a laugh, trying to shake off the gloom. “You’re right. Let’s just
      enjoy the hike.”`,
      `We walked for what felt like hours, the trail winding through dense
      forests and offering occasional glimpses of the valley below. Talha was
      chattering away, but I barely registered his words. My mind was still with
      her—Sanvi.`,
      `Then, as we rounded a bend, I froze. A small group of hikers was coming
      from the opposite direction, and among them was a face I couldn’t
      mistake. Sanvi.`,
      `She was laughing at something, her eyes sparkling in the dappled sunlight.
      My heart leapt to my throat, and for a moment, I forgot how to breathe.
      She hadn’t seen me yet, but the universe had decided to give me this one
      chance, this fleeting moment.`,

    title: "Encounter in the dense forest",
    content: [
      `It was a day that I didn’t anticipate would turn into a memory etched so
      deeply. The morning air in Nathiagali was crisp, the trail veiled in mist, as
      if nature had decided to keep secrets of its own. Talha, ever the cautious
      one, nudged me with a whisper when he spotted Sanvi from afar.`,
      `&quot;Hey Musavir, look! Isn’t that Sanvi madam, our master trainer?&quot; he said,
      eyes wide with panic.
      I followed his gaze and saw her, dressed simply yet exuding her usual
      poise. I nodded in agreement, feeling a strange mix of nerves and
      curiosity.`,
      `Talha, on the other hand, was ready to bolt. “We should hide or go back.
      If she notices, we’ll face consequences.”
      He clearly feared the sharp, commanding aura she always carried during
      training sessions. But I stayed rooted in my place. Deep down, I’d been
      hoping for this encounter, though I couldn’t explain why.`,
      `When I refused to turn back, Talha huffed and muttered something
      under his breath before retracing his steps. I continued, feeling a tug of
      anticipation. As I drew closer, she noticed me and greeted me with a
      brief nod, though her expression remained distant. Her friends, chatting
      and laughing, soon left after she asked them to pick her up from the
      Nathiagali point. And then, surprisingly, she decided to walk the trail with
      me.`,
      `Her silence was uncharacteristic, unsettling even. I had known Sanvi to be
      a person of unwavering confidence, someone whose words could command
      attention in a room full of people. But today, she seemed different. Her
      cold response earlier in the day still lingered in my mind, and I couldn&#39;t
      shake off the confusion it brought.`,
      `We walked without exchanging a single word, our footsteps the only sound
      breaking the quiet. The trail stretched ahead, flanked by dense pines and
      the occasional chirp of a bird. After a kilometer, we came across a
      wooden bench overlooking the valley. The view was breathtaking—quaint
      homes nestled on the hillsides, cattle grazing lazily, and lamps glowing
      faintly in the chilly, cloud-covered daylight.`,
      `We sat down, neither of us speaking. The silence between us was heavy,
      almost suffocating, yet I didn’t know how to break it. My mind raced with
      thoughts, each one starting with a question I couldn’t bring myself to ask.
      Was she upset? Was something troubling her?`,
      `Fifteen minutes passed like hours. Finally, I mustered the courage to say
      something, anything. “Let’s continue,” I said, standing up. “Evening is
      coming, and the signs warned about wildlife on the track.”`,
      `But just as I turned, I felt her hand on mine. I froze, her touch sending a
      wave of shock through me. For a moment, I doubted if it was real, but
      when I looked down, her hand was firmly holding mine.`,
      `I glanced at her, trying to read her expression. Her face was calm, yet
      her eyes held something I couldn’t quite decipher—vulnerability, maybe?
      Or something deeper? Whatever it was, it was unexpected, and I didn’t
      know how to react.`,
      `Though the touch felt oddly comforting, it left me speechless. The
      silence that followed wasn’t uncomfortable this time; it was charged with
      unspoken emotions. For once, even the valley below seemed to pause, as if
      it, too, waited for what would happen next.`,
      `And there, in the quiet cold of Nathiagali, I realized that some moments
      don’t need words—they just need to be felt.`,

      `My heart swelled with hope when Sanvi’s hand slipped into mine, a spark
      of warmth lighting up my chest. For a fleeting moment, I thought it was
      affection—something deeper, something real. But the illusion shattered
      like fragile glass when I turned and saw the source of her fear: a snake,
      coiled and still, just a few meters away. She hadn’t reached for me out of
      love. She had reached for safety.`,
      `“Snake!” she gasped.`,
      `I glanced at her. Her face was pale, her breath shallow, and her usually
      confident demeanor had crumbled. I knew I should probably say
      something reassuring, maybe tell her the snake was harmless or that it
      wouldn’t come near us, but I couldn’t find the words. My thoughts were
      far too consumed by the fact that her hand was in mine, something I’d
      quietly wished for since the day we met.`,
      `“Just… stay calm,” I managed to say, my voice steadier than I felt. “It’s
      not coming toward us. We’ll be fine.”`,
      `She nodded, but her grip didn’t loosen. If anything, it tightened. I
      couldn’t help but silently plead for the snake to stay right where it
      was—or better yet, slowly inch closer, just enough to keep her holding on.
      Her touch, born out of fear, felt like a lifeline I wasn’t ready to let go of.`,
      `For what felt like an eternity, we both stood frozen, watching the snake
      as it finally uncoiled and lazily slithered down the hill, disappearing into
      the undergrowth. Sanvi let out a shaky breath and released my hand. The
      sudden loss of her touch felt colder than the forest breeze.`,
      `She straightened, brushing off invisible dust from her jeans, and let out
      a nervous laugh. “Well, that was... unexpected.”`,
      `I smiled weakly, trying to mask the ache in my chest. “Yeah. Unexpected.”`,
      `She stretched her arms and took a deep breath, her confidence slowly
      returning. “Let’s keep going. We’re still a few kilometers from the end.”`,
      `I nodded and fell into step behind her, my mind replaying the moment
      over and over. I wanted to say something—anything—that might bring
      back the closeness I had felt, even if it was fleeting. But words failed me,
      and the silence between us grew heavier with each step.`,
      `For the next three kilometers, I followed her quietly, my eyes
      occasionally darting to the trail in the vain hope of spotting another
      snake—or any animal, really—that might recreate the moment. But the
      forest seemed devoid of such miracles now, as if it had conspired to keep
      me at a distance from her.`,
      `Finally, we reached the end of the track, where the trail opened into a
      small clearing overlooking a valley bathed in golden sunlight. Sanvi stopped
      and turned to me, her cheeks flushed from the walk, her ponytail slightly
      messy but still perfect.`,
      `“Musavir,” she said, breaking the silence. Her voice was soft, almost
      hesitant. “You’ve been awfully quiet. What’s on your mind?”`,
      `I blinked, caught off guard. Should I tell her? About the way her hand in
      mine had felt like the answer to a question I didn’t know I was asking?
      About how I wanted to freeze that moment in time, even if it was built on
      her fear? I opened my mouth but closed it again, unsure of how to begin.`,
      `Instead, I reached for the only thing I could think of. “Can we take a
      selfie?”`,
      `Her lips curved into a smile, and for a moment, I thought she might laugh
      at the absurdity of the request. But instead, she nodded. “Of course.”`,
      `She stepped closer, her shoulder brushing against mine as she held up my
      phone. I tried to smile naturally, though my mind was still racing. The
      camera clicked, and she showed me the photo—a perfect capture of her
      radiant smile, the setting sun casting a halo around her.`,
      `“Perfect,” she said, giving my phone back.`,
      `I nodded, though the ache in my chest remained. “Yeah. Perfect.”`,
      `As we began the journey back, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the real
      snake wasn’t the one we’d seen on the trail, but the one inside me—coiling
      tighter and tighter around my unspoken feelings.`,

      `Sanvi&#39;s friends picked her up from the finish point, and Talha met me
      there as well, hiding behind a cigarette cabin. Together, we headed back
      to PC Bhurban. It was around 8 p.m., and my mind was a tangled web of
      thoughts. Exhausted, I collapsed onto the bed, keeping phone in hand and
      looking at selfie where she was very close, unable to shake off the
      memory of her gripping my hand so firmly during the snake episode. That
      moment lingered in my mind like an unanswered question. But no thought
      could hold me for long; sleep claimed me quickly.`,
      `At 5 a.m., my eyes fluttered open. Sleeping so early had left me well-
      rested but restless. I changed into my tracksuit and stepped out for a
      walk, seeking solace in the crisp morning air. I wandered toward the
      outskirts of PC Bhurban, exploring the hiking trail nestled within the
      hotel grounds`,
      `The serene hills of Bhurbhan bathed in the first light of dawn, painting
      the sky with hues of amber and lilac. The air was crisp, carrying the faint
      scent of pine and earth. As I walked along the trail inside PC Bhurbhan,
      the events of the previous day swirled in my mind like a restless tide.
      Sanvi, her voice, her presence, and that brief, unexplained
      connection—everything seemed surreal.`,
      `I hadn’t expected to find her here at this hour. At the helipad, she
      looked serene, a picture of calm against the backdrop of the vast sky.
      Her yoga session was like poetry in motion—graceful, effortless. But I
      hesitated to approach her. Something about the moment felt too delicate
      to disturb.`,
      `I turned to leave, only to hear her voice call out. &quot;Musavir!&quot; It was
      unmistakable. Her tone carried warmth and familiarity, and it drew me
      back like a magnet.`,
      `She walked up to me, her expression light and cheerful. &quot;Good morning!&quot;
      she greeted, her smile almost disarming. We fell into step together, her
      presence brightening the stillness of the morning. As we walked, she
      asked me about my life—my native town, my posting, and my marital
      status. Her curiosity felt natural, not intrusive, and I found myself
      answering her questions with surprising ease.`,
      `When we reached the hotel, she suggested we have breakfast together. I
      agreed, trying not to overthink the meaning behind her invitation. At
      Nadia’s restaurant, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and warm bread
      filled the air. We talked between sips and bites, her laughter punctuating
      our conversation. For a moment, I forgot the world outside the cozy
      confines of that breakfast table.`,
      `Afterward, we walked back to our rooms in comfortable silence. Outside
      her door, I bade her goodbye, addressing her formally as “ma’am.” Her
      response was immediate, almost playful. &quot;Musavir,&quot; she called out again
      just as the door was about to close. &quot;Call me only Sanvi again.&quot;`,
      `Her words hung in the air, soft but firm, as though they carried a deeper
      meaning. I nodded, struggling to decipher her gaze, but her eyes were
      like a puzzle I wasn’t yet ready to solve.`,
      `She smiled, the door closing behind her, leaving me standing in the quiet
      hallway. For the first time in a long while, I felt a strange mix of hope
      and uncertainty. It was as if the day, much like her, had offered me
      something profound yet undefined—a possibility, perhaps, or a beginning.`,

      `Having dressed and prepared myself, I made my way to Xaver Hall. There
      was no rush today; I had ample time, and for once, I felt refreshed, even
      buoyant. My steps were small but confident, as though the rhythm of the
      morning had seeped into my being.`,
      `As I entered the hall, I noticed three or four participants already
      seated. With a polite smile, I shook hands with them before taking my
      place at the table marked with my name. The hum of murmured
      conversations filled the air as more people trickled in, one by one.`,
      `And then she appeared.`,
      `Her presence lit up the room effortlessly, her smile a warm greeting for
      everyone she passed. As she approached, my heart skipped in anticipation.
      But then it happened—a fleeting, cold glance, sharp and detached, as if I
      were a stranger.`,
      `That single look struck me like a bolt. It wasn&#39;t disdain, nor was it
      indifference. It was something in between—a calculated restraint that
      left me reeling.`,
      `What was that? I wondered, my thoughts spiraling.
      What is she trying to say? Why is she doing this to me?`,
      `Just an hour ago, she had been lively and warm, her laugh ringing like a
      melody shared only with me. Now, she was distant, untouchable, and the
      shift stung in ways I couldn’t understand.`,

      `I closed my eyes, trying to steady myself against the storm brewing
      within me—a tangled mess of frustration and something else I dared not
      name.`,
      `And then, as if she had been watching all along, she smiled. Not the polite
      kind she wore for the others, but something softer, more intentional.
      That smile—it was a salve, a lifeline. I couldn’t help but return it, my
      earlier frustration dissolving into reluctant admiration.`,
      `She was stunning today. Dressed in a dark blue pant suit paired with a
      deep purple shirt and a light blue tie, she had an air of effortless
      elegance. A neatly folded pocket square peeked from her blazer, and a
      Chopard watch adorned her wrist, catching the light. Her dark red
      lipstick was bold yet tasteful, complementing the slight eyeliner that
      accentuated her sharp gaze. Her hair cascaded freely over her shoulders,
      completing the look of someone utterly self-assured.`,
      `She was, quite simply, magnetic—a force impossible to ignore. A person
      who seemed made to be adored, to occupy the thoughts of others without
      even trying.`,
      `But Sanvi... she was more than just a vision. She was a sensation, a storm
      I couldn’t contain. My feelings—unnamed yet undeniable—swirled within
      me, potent and overwhelming.`,
      `It wasn’t just admiration or attraction. It felt like love—raw, unrefined,

      my room, I stepped out of the hotel, craving the crispness of fresh air.
      The lobby bustled with activity; porters wheeled luggage, guiding newly
      arrived guests to their rooms. Among them, a couple caught my
      attention—a newly married pair, seemingly Baloch.`,

      itself—stands against me.`,

      mother to feed him, and just when she arrives, the bowl in which she
      carried the food slips from her hands and shatters… leaving nothing left

      only to find yourself standing in a pitiful place, confronted by what feels
      like two hundred percent resistance. That’s what happened the day she

      fleeting second, I wished—God, I wished—it had been out of love. But it
      was fear.`,

      In these heights, daylight dies early. The old yellow taxi we found rattled
      more loudly than it moved, its engine groaning as if it were dragging the
      entire valley behind it. A freezing breeze slipped through the broken
      edge of the left window, brushing my face—but even that cold sting
      wasn’t enough to cool the warmth pulsing in my chest.`,
      `A warmth that came from anticipation. From fear. From hope.`,
      `From the card in my pocket.`,

      `GPO Road was overflowing with life, choked with traffic that moved at a
      snail’s pace. The taxi crawled forward, inch by inch, until impatience took
      over. I asked Talha if we should walk the rest of the way. He agreed
      without hesitation, and soon we were moving toward GPO Chowk on foot.`,
      `Talha spoke endlessly about the area. He had studied here once—from
      class six to matric—at the Ghora Galli Campus. Every turn stirred a
      memory for him. For me, none of it mattered. My mind was elsewhere,
      waiting for the moment I could say goodbye and head toward VivaPines.`,
      `When we reached GPO, the place felt oddly festive. People stood on the
      grand stairs, posing for photographs as if history itself framed their
      smiles. Nearby, vendors sold printondemand mugs, writing whatever words
      the customers wished to carry home. To the right, police stood behind

      When we reached GPO, the place felt oddly festive. People stood on the
      grand stairs, posing for photographs as if history itself framed their
      smiles. Nearby, vendors sold printondemand mugs, writing whatever words
      the customers wished to carry home. To the right, police stood behind
      barricades, halting traffic toward Punjab House. The scene felt busy yet
      detached, like a world moving without me.`,
      `On the left, a shawl shop caught my eye.`,
      `“I need to buy a shawl for my family,” I told Talha.`,
      `He nodded and said he would wait for me there.`,
      `Inside the shop, my eyes settled on a skincolored shawl. For some reason,
      I felt it would suit Sanvi perfectly. I bought it without second thoughts.
      When I returned, Talha and I shared a light meal—nothing memorable,
      just something to fill the pause between moments.`,
      `Afterward, I told him I had to leave.`,
      `He asked what I was planning next, but I avoided the question. Some
      things felt better left unsaid. We hugged like old buddies, and I walked
      away toward VivaPines. My watch read 6:24.`,
      `I couldn’t name the feeling inside me. I didn’t know what stirred in my
      chest, nor what waited ahead. Questions circled my mind without answers.`,
      `As VivaPines came into view, I muttered to myself, Not bad.`,
      `The building stood gracefully against the mountains, its structure elegant,
      its lights adding a quiet charm. It looked inviting—almost expectant.`,
      `I stepped inside and approached the checkin counter.`,
      `“I need a room,” I said.`,
      `“Certainly, sir,” the lady replied. “May I have your CNIC number?”`,
      `I handed it over.`,
      `She paused. “Sir… there is already a booking under your name.”`,
      `I froze.`,
      `Another shock followed quickly—how did Sanvi get my CNIC number?`,
      `I was lost in these thoughts when someone called my name, pulling me
      back to the present.`,
      `“Yes—yes?” I replied.`,
      `“Sir, your room is number 407, on the fourth floor.”`,
      `“All right,” I said, and headed toward the lift.`,
      `407. 407. 407.`,
      `The number echoed in my mind as the lift doors opened. I unlocked the
      door with the key card and stepped inside. Almost immediately, I sensed
      someone else’s presence—someone already in the room. The restroom
      light was on.`,
      `It had to be Sanvi.`,
      `But how? I had the original CNIC with me. Hotels usually demand it at
      checkin.`,
      `I sat on the chair, confused, yet quietly happy. Then, suddenly, the
      bathroom door opened.`,
      `The person standing in front of me made my heart lose its rhythm.`,
      `I was completely undone.`,

    title: "Disappointment",
    content: [
      `We grow up believing that tragedy belongs to cinema screens and
      television serials, neatly packaged with background music and closing
      credits. Real life, we assume, will be gentler. Yet life, too, knows how to
      dramatize its moments—quietly, intimately, without warning.`,
      `My mind was weaving scenes of its own. I felt happy and confused at once,
      as if my heart was standing at a crossroads, unsure of which direction to
      choose. That fleeting happiness, however, began to soften into
      disappointment, then into a familiar ache of frustration. I wish I weren’t
      here, I thought. But this was life, and life follows its own script—one
      already written. Still, I wondered where the chapter called happiness had
      gone missing. Why did joy arrive only as a brief whisper, born of my
      thoughts rather than reality, only to be followed by long passages of
      longing and quiet sorrow?`,
      `The person standing before me was not Sanvi.`,
      `It was Saira Majeed.`,
      `A colleague from another federal department—someone I had never truly
      seen until this moment. Her presence gently pulled me back from my
      thoughts.`,
      `“I suppose you were waiting for someone else?” she asked, her voice soft,
      almost teasing.`,
      `Yes, my heart replied. Always.`,
      `“No,” I said instead, forcing a faint smile. “That’s not the case.”`,
      `She laughed—a warm, unguarded sound. “I never knew the chit was from
      you.”`,
      `Before I could respond, she continued, “You didn’t notice me at the ghazal
      night. Not at the Golf Club, not even at Nadia’s Restaurant. But I noticed
      you.” She paused, her gaze steady. “I always did.”`,
      `Her words unsettled me, not with fear, but with tenderness. “I felt you
      today,” she added quietly. “During the tea break, in the ballroom. There
      was something… warm.”`,
      `I stayed silent, unsure of how to respond. My thoughts drifted to Ghalib,
      rising uninvited from the depths of memory:`,
      `Jannat mein sattar hooron ka tasavvur laakh sahi, Ghalib,
      Hum aik shakhs ke sehar se niklein to wahan tak pohnchein.`,
      `Yet even poetry failed me. My heart was still tethered to Sanvi, even as
      another presence stood before me, real and breathing.`,
      `Then I felt it—a warmth that was no longer imagined.`,
      `Saira gently took my hands into hers. Her touch was careful, almost
      reverent, as if she feared I might disappear. She stepped closer, close
      enough for me to sense her breath, close enough for silence to speak.`,

    content: [
      `It was the most delicate moment of my life—the kind of moment where
      restraint itself feels like punishment. I was starving for hope, for
      happiness, for someone to hold me steady, and yet I was forcing myself
      to stand still. After days of chasing Sanvi in my thoughts, this was the
      perfect chance to let go, to surrender to the current and stop resisting.
      But my subconscious—my feelings for Sanvi—held me back, tightening its
      grip around my will.`,
      `“Hey, Saira… what are you doing?” I finally said.`,
      `To be honest, I had been waiting for someone else. Had I known it would
      be her, I would never have come. She was married, with a beautiful child.
      Why was she risking everything—why was she trying to fracture her own
      world?`,
      `“Don’t try to be my master, Musavir,” she snapped softly. “If I’m here,
      it’s because I want to be. Why are you questioning everything? Why can’t
      you just live in the moment?”`,
      `I stayed quiet.`,
      `“Musavir,” she continued, her voice trembling, “I’ve been in love with you
      since the day we hosted you for dinner. I don’t want promises. I don’t
      want attachments. I just want to cherish these moments with you. That’s
      why I invited you here. Otherwise, it would have been easy—too easy—in
      PC.”`,
      `I had no words.`,
      `“Can’t you feel me?” she whispered. “I’m empty inside. Can’t you pour some
      warmth into my blood?”`,
      `Outside, the cold had tightened its claws around the night. My body
      shivered—not just from the weather, but from the weight of the moment
      itself. Anyone who could control such a moment must have been a saint.`,
      `I was not one.`,
      `In my helplessness, a verse echoed in my mind like a curse I could not
      escape:`,
      `Main tum se pehle gunaah karta tha,
      Mujh ko diya gaya hai azaab—yaani tum.`,
      `I had always been a sinner; sainthood was never meant for me.`,
      `Overwhelmed, I pulled her into my arms. Her embrace was warm, gentle,
      and dangerously comforting. She fit against me as if she had always
      belonged there. Her closeness carried a strange magic—her warmth, her
      breath, her presence wrapped around my senses and blurred my resolve.`,
      `In that closeness, she seemed fully alive, fully immersed, as if nothing
      existed beyond those fleeting moments. Every touch felt unreal—soft,
      fragile, almost luminous.`,
      `And yet, somewhere deep inside, a voice screamed.`,
      `Sanvi… was that not feeling?
      If it was, then what is this?
      Why am I losing myself in Saira?`,
      `The realization hit me like a blow.`,
      `I pushed Saira back, stepped away, and stood up. My hands trembled as I
      dressed. Without looking back, I walked out of Room 407, carrying
      confusion heavier than guilt—and silence louder than any confession.`,

      `The rain was merciless. Within minutes, I was drenched, standing on the roadside, my eyes scanning blindly for a cab that refused to appear. The downpour was so fierce that the world around me dissolved into a grey blur; I could barely see a few steps ahead. I ran aimlessly for nearly ten minutes—here, there, everywhere—water clinging to my clothes, guilt weighing heavier than the rain itself. Inside, something was breaking, silently crying.`,
      `When I finally found a taxi, relief lasted only a second. The driver shook his head firmly. He refused to go in such weather. Helpless, with nowhere else to turn, I stood there waiting, seeking refuge until the thunder softened and the rain surrendered. I don’t know what changed his mind, but suddenly the same driver pulled up beside me again.`,
      `“Okay,” he said, almost casually. “I’ll take you.”`,
      `The journey was long and exhausting. The driver talked endlessly—about roads, weather, life—but his words floated past me unheard. My heart was too heavy, my mind too crowded with guilt to hold on to anything else. After nearly two hours, we finally reached PC Bhurban.`,
      `Inside the room, I changed my soaked clothes. My body trembled uncontrollably from the cold. Without thinking, I collapsed onto the bed. I don’t remember falling asleep; I only know that sleep claimed me.`,
      `I woke up to a loud knock on the door.`,
      `Barely conscious, I dragged myself up and opened it. Talha stood there.`,
      `“Bro, why didn’t you come to class today? It’s already 12 p.m.”`,
      `I had no strength to explain anything. “I’m not feeling well,” I muttered. That was all. I picked up my phone, emailed the focal person, and watched Talha return to class. Then I went back to bed.`,
      `Knock. Knock.`,
      `This time it was softer. I opened one eye and glanced at the wall clock—4 p.m.`,
      `What is happening to me?`,
      `I forced myself up and opened the door. Housekeeping.`,
      `“Sir, the room hasn’t been cleaned for two days. If you don’t mind, may we take fifteen minutes?”`,
      `“No,” I said coldly. “I’m not well.” I shut the door and returned to the bed.`,
      `Knock. Knock.`,
      `Again, I woke up. The clock now showed 7 p.m. With no energy left in me, I leaned against the wall and opened the door. Talha stood there once more.`,
      `“Bro, what’s wrong with you? Why aren’t you coming out?”`,
      `“I’m not feeling well,” I replied flatly. “Go for dinner.”`,
      `He offered to take me out. I refused. I told him I was fed up with continental food. Before he could say anything more, I closed the door again.`,
      `It wasn’t sickness. It was guilt—pure, suffocating guilt. What I had done was wrong. I couldn’t face Sanvi. Worse, I couldn’t face myself. I threw myself back onto the bed.`,
      `Knock. Knock.`,
      `A soft, hesitant knock.`,
      `I opened my eyes. The clock read 1 a.m.`,
      `Not again, I thought. Talha, please stop this possessiveness.`,
      `I stayed still.`,
      `Knock. Knock.`,
      `Same rhythm.`,
      `This can’t be Talha, I told myself. He doesn’t have this much patience. It must be hotel staff.`,
      `Gathering what little courage I had left, I opened the door.`,
      `Sanvi.`,
      `The sight of her drowned me completely. I wasn’t expecting her. I didn’t want to face her. My mind froze, thoughts collapsing into silence.`,
      `She smiled and pulled me back into the moment.`,
      `“Don’t you offer guests coffee?”`,
      `Embarrassed, I stepped aside. “I’m sorry. Please, come in.”`,
      `She sat down. I made two cups of coffee and handed one to her, then sat on the chair across from her. She looked at me in a way she never had before—romantic, gentle, possessive. It was the look I had always longed for. And yet, it felt undeserved. What I had done made this moment feel impure, almost unfaithful to her innocence.`,
      `Lost in my own interrogation, I barely noticed when she spoke.`,
      `“Stupid,” she said softly, smiling. “Girls don’t take the initiative.”`,
      `I smiled weakly. She moved closer.`,
      `“Please stop,” I said suddenly. “I need to confess something.”`,
      `She stepped back and looked at me, waiting.`,
      `“I cheated on you yesterday,” I said, my voice trembling.`,
      `She smiled faintly. “This isn’t the time for jokes, love.”`,
      `“I’m not joking.” And then I told her everything—every detail of what happened at VivaPines.`,
      `Her eyes filled with tears. I had always believed that working women were emotionally strong, bold enough to absorb pain. But she wasn’t bold in that way. She was delicate—achingly so.`,
      `Without a word, she rushed out of the room.`,
      `I sank to the floor, clutching my head in my hands, alone with the weight of what I had destroyed.`,

      `Why does it happen? When something you love comes to you, and you push it away? Is it guilt? Maybe. But I think it’s deeper than that. It’s the fear that once you have it, you might lose its value.`,
      `Sanvi was only a few inches away, and I let her go. I made her cry. I am the one who destroys everything. I’m the sinner. Oh, God, what have I done?`,
      `I don’t know what took me into that deep sleep, but when I woke up, it felt like I hadn’t slept at all. My head was heavy, my eyes swollen, and my hair a mess. I assumed I had been fighting with myself the entire night.`,
      `I mustered the courage to get up and head for the restroom. The shower was supposed to refresh me, but I stood under it for at least thirty minutes, lost in my thoughts. I only snapped out of it when I heard a knock at the door. I peered through the peephole—Talha.`,
      `“Talha! I’m in the shower. Go on ahead. I’ll be out in a minute,” I called.`,
      `I quickly finished washing, dressed, grabbed my diary, and left for Xavier Hall without even eating breakfast.`,
      `Saira was already sitting there. I greeted her with a "Good morning," but she didn’t respond. It felt like I was the cause of all the tension in the room. I made my way to my seat, feeling like I was drowning in regret.`,
      `Soon, the hall started to fill with people, and then I saw her.`,
      `A purple shirt, black pants, pink tie, long brown coat, black pocket square, her hair pulled back in a ponytail, and that same, elegant smile. As always, she was a picture of grace.`,
      `She glanced at me. No regrets, no tears, no complaints. It was as if nothing had happened. But I could feel myself fading away—drowning, suffocating, dying inside.`,
      `She gave her closing remarks with that same smile, distributed certificates of participation. When it was my turn to receive mine, I expected her to ask someone else to hand it to me. But no. She stood there, still smiling, and handed me the certificate herself. Her eyes didn’t betray any emotion—just the same blank smile, as if I no longer existed to her. Perhaps, she had exhausted all her feelings for me the night before.`,
      `Feeling utterly defeated, I returned to my seat. She shook hands with everyone and left without a word. As the rest of us filed out, I stayed behind, staring at the door where she had just exited.`,
      `We were supposed to stay one more night for a common dinner at PC, but then news broke out. A Hindu family had been accused of blasphemy in Lahore, and a religious leader had called for a protest the next day. Everyone had to leave immediately. Tickets were rescheduled, and we were all crammed into a coach—including her. The government had planned to reroute all international passengers to Karachi, as Islamabad and Punjab were on the hit list.`,
      `The coach set off, and for a while, it seemed like we might make it out safely. But when we reached Bara Kaho, the situation changed. Rocks, thorns, and tree branches were scattered across the road. A group of ten men stood in front of the coach, signaling us to stop.`,
      `When the coach finally halted, two of them climbed aboard. “We have a report that a Hindu family is on this coach,” one of them said. My heart sank. I feared for Sanvi.`,
      `Having dealt with secret service operations before, I stepped forward to negotiate.`,
      `“Listen,” I said, “you must have received bad information. There’s no Hindu family on this bus. We’re all Muslims here.”`,
      `Before I could say more, a voice from behind interrupted, making my blood run cold.`,
      `“I’m Hindu.”`,
      `Sanvi. She had spoken.`,
      `Before anyone could rush toward her, I acted on instinct. I punched one man hard in the face and kicked the other out of the coach. “Drive!” I shouted at the driver.`,
      `The bus lurched forward, and rocks began hitting the windows, cracking the front screen. The driver accelerated, thankfully, and we sped away. It wasn’t until later, when we were safely away from the checkpoint, that I realized the government had shut down signals. Otherwise, the attackers would have been able to alert their allies.`,
      `By the time we reached Peshawar Mor, things had escalated even further. A mob was checking vehicles. I told the driver to stop, but I could already sense that things were going south.`,
      `“Come with me,” I said, reaching out to Sanvi.`,
      `“No,” she replied flatly.`,
      `“Listen,” I said, grabbing her hand, “there’s a checkpoint ahead. We could be in real danger if they stop us. Come on, just trust me.”`,
      `“I’m not going anywhere,” she said, her voice cold.`,
      `I pulled her by the hand, and though she resisted for a few moments, she eventually stopped fighting me. We both got off the bus, and I asked the driver to move on without us.`,
      `We took cover in the bushes for a few minutes before trying to make our way to the airport on foot, avoiding the roads. Her hand was firmly in mine, and we ran. For hours, we ran, neither of us speaking, just focusing on the destination.`,
      `After three long hours, we finally saw the airport in the distance. But Sanvi was exhausted, thirsty, and her feet were bleeding. I told her to keep going. We were so close now.`,
      `We barely managed to make it another kilometer when we encountered two men standing in our path. They looked rough—untidy, impolite, and rude.`,
      `“What are you two doing out here, alone?” one of them sneered. “Sweets should be shared. You should’ve come prepared.”`,
      `“Listen,” I said, trying to keep my cool, “We’re trying to get to the airport. We’ve been walking for hours. Is it really necessary to act this way?”`,
      `“Guests should bring gifts for the hosts,” one of them said, his grin widening. “And we’re the hosts.”`,
      `My blood boiled. I wasn’t in a position to fight, but I wasn’t going to let these men touch her.`,
      `I was about to step forward when Sanvi stopped me.`,
      `“I’ll serve their interests,” she said, her voice devoid of emotion.`,
      `Her words were like a punch to my gut. I wasn’t expecting this. I wasn’t ready for it. I stepped in front of her.`,
      `“You don’t have to do this. Please, don’t…” I pleaded.`,
      `But she wouldn’t listen. She walked toward the bushes with one of the men, leaving the other one to stand in front of me.`,
      `My anger reached its peak, and before I could stop myself, I threw a punch at the man, hitting him in the neck. He fell, gasping for air, as he reached for his phone.`,
      `The other man rushed toward me, but before he could reach me, Sanvi appeared from behind the bushes and hit him with a rock, knocking him out cold.`,
      `It was a trap, and now they were both down.`,
      `We ran the last stretch toward the airport, barely making it. Sanvi’s feet were bleeding, but we were finally there.`,
