## Why do we forget major events (both joyful and tragic) in life, yet remember small, seemingly insignificant moments forever?

> “Our minds tend to forget even the biggest joyful or tragic events when they occur frequently. When pain or happiness becomes a routine, we grow used to it — it no longer leaves a deep mark.
> Familiarity dulls emotional intensity over time. However, rare moments — no matter how small — stay etched in our subconscious because of their uniqueness.
> These one-time events, whether joyful or heartbreaking, break the rhythm of our emotional experiences and become unforgettable.”

We remember what stands out, not what repeats. Unforgettable experiences often share one or more of these traits:

* **Something that happens once in a lifetime** — a fleeting smile from a stranger that changed your mood or a failure that taught you more than success ever could.
* **A moment you never saw coming**, making it powerful and vivid.
* **Moments where emotions were intense**, regardless of the scale of the event.
* **When you defy expectations or fall short of them**, the impact is amplified by how society views it.
* **Achievements or failures that carried deep personal value** — something you longed for or feared deeply.

Memory isn’t about the size of the event; it’s about emotional contrast, rarity, and personal significance.

**What happens every day fades? What happens once, stays.**`,

    title: "Gen Z: The Storm or the Sunshine?",
    content: `
There was a time when a word of correction was not an insult, but a gesture of care, a quiet reminder that someone still believed in you. When a child misbehaved, any elder; be it a teacher, a neighbor, or even the shopkeeper across the street could offer a word of guidance, and the parents would nod in appreciation.

In those days, the village truly raised the child. Back then, homes had open doors and open hearts. A teacher's scolding carried more weight than a parent's lecture, and a father's silence could make a son rethink his choices. Faith guided our actions, and respect for elders wasn't demanded—it was instinctive. Life was slower, conversations were longer, and the world, though smaller, felt more connected.

But as the calendar turned and the internet became our new neighborhood, something changed. **Generation Z** (born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s)—the first truly digital-native generation—now sees correction as intrusion.
“Let me live my life,” they say, believing freedom must mean complete independence.
For many, authority is outdated, tradition is restrictive, and faith is optional.

They live by phrases like **YOLO** (You Only Live Once); hence, they want to enjoy and thrill at any cost.
When counselled to follow moral codes, they often question "why" instead of "how". Such mantras have become a tool for Gen Z to justify their violations.
A teenager may pass hours in crafting a TikTok dance or making an Instagram reel but rarely bothers to enquire about becoming a good human being. What they prioritize now is to become rich by 25, travel before 30, and become famous before 35. Even at home, a parent's advice competes with the voices of influencers online—some preaching hustle culture, others romanticizing rebellion.

As an inevitable fact, Gen Z is vibrant and creative, with the power to architect their own fortune even before they turn into adults. Yet, beneath their brilliance, there is a lack of moral grounding. With values pushed to the background, they struggle to find meaning beyond success, likes, or followers.
"They know how to make a trending reel but lag behind when it comes to consoling a grieving friend."
They have an abundance of content to sell, yet very little of it is aimed at societal reform. 

We celebrate achievements, but rarely ask: *Are we becoming better human beings?*. A teenager may debate climate change online yet fail to greet the gardener outside. Progress, it seems, has come at the cost of connection.

Still, this is not a story of despair, it is a call to renewal. Gen Z cannot be regulated by hours of lectures, but experiences only can touch their heart. Schools will have to introduce value-based education that moves beyond slogans.
For instance, they may be engaged in community projects with NGOs or shelter homes where they can learn to care for the elderly, plant trees, or share half of their bread with a hungry child. Such activities can nurture kindness in their hearts and pull them away from being mere slaves to technology.
Likwise, storytelling can work wonders. Gen Z will ask questions, elders will respond, and the two-way conversation will result in wisdom meeting curiosity, making both grow richer.

And, since Gen Z's world is digital, rather than keeping them away from it, we must teach digital skills that focus upon how to disagree without disrespecting, how to verify before sharing, and how to respond instead of reacting.
Technology itself is not the villain, indifference is. If used wisely, smartphones may serve as a platform for awareness and social change.

Every generation comes with a storm but also its sunshine. Take ourselves, the **millennials** (born between 1981 to 1996); we too were a challenge for the generations before us.
Gen Z's rebellion is not an act of rejection but a search for purpose in this world. They need ears that listen to them, they need proofs, and they seek evidence because they perceive everything through a scientific lens. Hence, instead of herding them, we must guide them towards the right path.

It is high time to remind the youth and ourselves that progress without a purpose is emptiness. For when wisdom meets youth, and faith meets freedom, humanity progresses.`,

    title: "Social Media as an Equalizer",
    content: `
In the era of digitization, social media has emerged as one of the most powerful forces of present time. From a simple tool of communication, it has turned into a powerful platform that outdo geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic boundaries. Social media has made it possible that ignored voices are no more ignored, they are although heard and aggrieved ones are now consoled. In this sense, social media functions as an equalizer, reshaping power dynamics in society.
At its core, social media serves as a powerful equalizer by equal access to information for everyone, louden marginalized voices, and creating opportunities in the digital economy. However, its full potential can only be cherished by addressing persistent challenges such as digital illiteracy, connectivity gaps, and algorithmic biases that threaten to undermine its inclusive promise.

The social media as an equalizer is clearly visible in its role in wake of global movements for justice. Movements such as BlackLivesMatter and MeToo demonstrate how global attention against chaos and injustice can be drawn regardless of social standings. These movements by the dint of social media have bypassed traditional media gatekeepers which always work at hands of some influential and have let common man narrate their own experiences.

Beyond activism, it has created numerous opportunities for financial independence. It has given financial literacy to an extent that for earnings and financial independence, very few rely on formal education for making money. Platforms like YouTube, Instagram and Ticktock etc have enabled content creators to be famous beyond borders. They through their following can easily seek PR packages, get opportunities in media houses in advertisements and even in serials. Social media platforms have opened corridors for new comers beyond borders where everyone with good content and out of the box ideas can easily make their places and become independent.

> “Social media serves as a powerful equalizer by democratizing access to information, amplifying marginalized voices, and creating opportunities in the digital economy, though its full potential can only be realized through addressing challenges like digital literacy, connectivity gaps, and algorithmic biases.”

Social media serves as a platform that mobilizes resources for humanitarian causes. Previously, mobilizing people was an uphill task, with uncertainty about whether donated resources were reaching the deserving or not. However, social media has made this process more transparent and efficient: funds can now be transferred directly into accounts, and formal setups exist in the form of Facebook pages, official email addresses, and complaint boxes in offices. In addition, there are reporting mechanisms for fraudulent activities, enabling the public to identify and expose wrongdoing.

Social media makes cultural exchange and its understanding across borders in multiple ways. First, instant interaction removes geographical boundaries. People from different regions can communicate on social media applications and educate other masses about themes of their cultures and in this way learning from right people lessens biases against such cultures. Other than communication. By providing opportunities to express ones concerns, upload ones content and address objections, social media has proved to be the bridge between different cultures of the world.

Along with all these marvels of social media, there are certain challenges it has been associated with it which may hinder the say of equity. First, the digital divide remains a significant obstacle. Digital divide refers to the gap between people with modern technologies and those who lack them. Moreover, misinformation and cyberbully are the major threat to social cohesion. Social media has also proved to be a double-edged sword which on the one hand work as an equalizer and on the other, divides societies, defames individuals, and, in many cases, threatens lives.

To maximize potential of social media, expansion of internet access to countryside, providing digital literacy in order to use it effectively and ensuring implementation of ethical regulations are need of an hour.
If we commit to the ethical values, address challenges associated with social media, and act as responsible citizens, social media can create even greater marvels.

    title: "In the Age of Misinformation, Truth is the First Casualty",
    content: `
  The digital revolution has created an era of limitless information, where news travels instantly, often without regard for its truthfulness.

  “In the contemporary age of misinformation, the principle of valuing truth above all else has eroded under the weight of political influence, bias, and polarization”

  ## Current Manifestation of Truth Being the First Casualty

  * In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread misinformation about vaccines placed countless lives in jeopardy.
  * During clashes whether between Russia-Ukraine, India-Pakistan, Pak-Afghanistan and in any other region both state and non-state actors have spread propaganda and fake news to shape global narratives.
  * The 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed how targeted fake news can manipulate democratic outcomes.

  ## How Truth Becomes the First Casualty in the Age of Misinformation

  1. **Social media platforms amplify sensational and emotionally charged content**, prioritizing engagement over accuracy.
  2. **The fast speed of online information sharing** sidelines fact-checking, to occupy early impressions.
  3. Political polarization has led people preferring comforting lies over inconvenient truths.
  4. Yellow journalism and race of TRPs have weakened professional ethics and fact checks.
  5. Relentless pursuit of fame and wealth has come at stake of upholding truth.
  6. Since the media outlets run at advertisements extended by governments, the truth is first thing to be compromised.

  ## The Case Study of Pakistan

  1. The proliferation of social media platforms has opened wider floodgates for rumors, propaganda, and misinformation in Pakistan.
  2. Narrative building in Pakistan has increasingly become dependent on social media platforms, rendering official media outlets largely paralyzed.
  3. Fabricated religious decrees and doctored sermons, spread through social media, have at times incited mob violence or targeted minority groups.

  **Way-Forward**

  **Conclusion:** The act of sharing selective, policy-based information has undermined the media’s core duty of protecting victims. Instead, it has reduced the media to a tool in the hands of the influential.
